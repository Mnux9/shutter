# Shutter
Camera shutter controlled by raspberry pi.

## Description
My old camera doesn't have any intervalometer function so i made this dogy script to controll the shutter with a raspberry pi's GPIO pins 

## Wiring
The wiring is very simple:

Just take the camera apart (dont get zaped by the flash capacitor like I did) and tap into shutter button pins.
